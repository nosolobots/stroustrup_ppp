2. If we define the median of a sequence as “a number so that exactly as many elements come before it in the sequence as
   come after it,” fix the program in §4.6.3 so that it always prints out a median. 
   Hint: A median need not be an element of the sequence
   
3. Read a sequence of double values into a vector. Think of each value as the distance between two cities along a given
   route. Compute and print the total distance (the sum of all distances). Find and print the smallest and greatest 
   distance between two neighboring cities. Find and print the mean distance between two neighboring cities.

4. Write a program to play a numbers guessing game. The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and your program
   asks questions to figure out what the number is (e.g., “Is the number you are thinking of less than 50?”). Your program
   should be able to identify the number after asking no more than seven questions. Hint: Use the < and <= operators and 
   the if-else construct.
   
5. Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. Your calculator should be able to handle the four basic math
   operations — add, subtract, multiply, and divide — on two input values. Your program should prompt the user to enter
   three arguments: two double values and a character to represent an operation. If the entry arguments are 35.6, 24.1, and
   '+', the program output should be <font color="blue">The sum of 35.6 and 24.1 is 59.7</font>.
