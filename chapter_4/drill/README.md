### Drill

1. Write a program that consists of a while-loop that (each time around the loop)
reads in two INTs and then prints them. Exit the program when a terminating '|' is entered.

2. Change the program to write out the smaller value is: followed by the smaller of the
numbers and the larger value is: followed by the larger value.
